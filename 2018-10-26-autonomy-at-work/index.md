Autonomy plays a crucial role in how we feel at work and how we see ourselves. While there is much pride to be taken in a job well done, having some degree of freedom over how to do it gives you that feeling of being more than a cog in someone else’s machine. Your decisions and your actions are a big part of what makes you… you!

# Being autonomous is having the freedom to make your own decisions.

## A prerequisite is trust in your judgement, all the way from the top of the hierarchy down to yourself. Without trust, there is no space for autonomy.

In industries where skilled workers are scarce, you can easily grant yourself much more autonomy than some would believe, but that does not come close to what trust gives you.

## When talking about trust, emotions can come into play in a bad way.

If you or others have had bad experiences in the past, there is a high risk of self-censorship. This gets worse as the number of intermediaries increases between the person with an idea and the person with decision power. Great ideas are very easy to dismiss, and that is a net loss for the company as a whole.

When people are very involved in a project and care a lot about it, a breach of trust can have a devastating effect. They might lose interest in the project altogether, they might refrain from ever sharing their ideas again, and other nice things brought to you by Hurt Feelings™.

Second-guessing the hierarchy’s future decisions will only make the problem worse whatsoever.

# Being autonomous is supposedly about assuming responsibility for the decisions you make and taking ownership of their consequences.

## I think that is up to debate, since it goes against the idea of a blameless culture.

Collective ownership of failures is core to making people feel safe, and it comes back to the agile principle that you should assume that people are doing the best they can.

This is especially true when bad decisions cascade into an incident: it is very easy to blame the last people in the chain but misdirected blame will create even more problems. People on the wrong end of the blame gun will just make sure that next time there’s an incident, nobody will know. And there will be a next time since the root cause has not been fixed. Instead of failing fast and correcting, the project will end up failing when it’s too late to change anything anymore.

## “By not making people responsible, you make them irresponsible.”

While any nuance has been left off to allow the clever word play, there is still some truth to this saying.

Electrical engineers know how crucial negative feedback is in making a system converge. You need to build a feedback loop if you want to reach a target. But it’s not just about having some negative feedback, it’s about having the right amount. Too little of it and your system will take forever to reach its target, too much of it and it’ll overreact at the slightest mistake.

The metaphor holds when talking about people. It’s always a question of balance between having enough feedback to keep things under control and enough freedom to keep the fresh ideas coming.

Another way to think about it is like a wheel held by a screw : if the screw is too loose, the wheel will wiggle, but if it’s too tight, the wheel will be stuck.

# Finally, there is the question of standards.

## What standard do you hold yourself up to?

> Are you the kind to take action even if the context is not in your favor?
> Are you the kind to project failures onto yourself? (My experiment failed, therefore I’m a failure.)

## What standard does your company hold its employees to?

> Are you expected to just sit there and wait until someone else dares to make a decision?

# Strategies to make things better:

## At the lower levels of the hierarchy, dare.

Break the status quo and actively show that you can do more. The rewards are well worth the pseudo-risk which exists mostly in our heads. Set up escape hatches in your team to defuse stressful situations: “if you mess up, you’ll have to bring breakfast for everyone tomorrow”, that’s gamification at work.

## As a decision maker, delegate.

Make yourself accessible: be present and interact regularly with the teams. Make sure that people are not afraid of you, nothing good can happen if they feel threatened when you just say “Hi!” to them. The “Leader vs manager” ideas are still very relevant. There is no point in recruiting the best people if you’re not willing to bet the company’s success on them. That is especially true if creativity and innovation are key to the company’s success.

Thanks for reading this far! I hope this gave you a few ideas on how to get the ball rolling for more autonomy in your work. I’ll end this piece with a Buddhist quote which I believe sums up why we ended up where we are, and why it’s up to each of us to fix it:

> “There is something aggressive about that approach to life, trying to flatten out all the rough spots and imperfections into a nice smooth ride.” ― Pema Chödrön
